# Currency Converter - Chrome extension
This is a small project to get familiar with fetch-API, Json, building extensions and some other technologies.
The converter will focus on converting limited number of currencies to USD-dollar for the moment. Why ? because I got more important projects to work on, in React and NodeJs.
This project can be used to build more complicated extension, with more currencies and features.
It is completly free to use, just remember to use your own API key, in case I delete mine.
