# Currency Converter - Chrome extension
The currency converter will focus on converting limited number of currencies to USD-dollar at this the moment. <br>
Because I got some private projects in React combined with Tailwind/Material UI to work on, other currencies won't be added, as the project is for training.
The code can be easily used to build more complicated extension, with more currencies and features.

Note: It is completely free to use code, just remember to use your own API key, in case I delete mine.

### This project focus on:
* Building extensions in chrome specifically
* Using API 
* Getting familiar with fetch-API, Json, Promises
* Using HTML, CSS and JavaScript

## Technologies used: HTML CSS JavaScript
